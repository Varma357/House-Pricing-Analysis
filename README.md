# Bengaluru House Price Prediction | Data Analytics & Machine Learning Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Bengaluru real estate data and builds a machine learning model to predict house prices based on property features such as location, size (BHK), square footage, and number of bathrooms. The project demonstrates end-to-end data analytics, feature engineering, and predictive modeling using Python.

## Business Problem
Property prices in Bengaluru vary significantly across locations and property types. Buyers, sellers, and investors often struggle to estimate fair property values.

### Objectives:
- Identify key factors influencing house prices
- Predict house prices using historical real estate data
- Provide data-driven insights for real estate decision-making

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Programming Language: Python  
- Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy  
- Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (Linear Regression)  
- Environment: Jupyter Notebook  
- Version Control: Git, GitHub

## Key Responsibilities & Skills Demonstrated
- Cleaned and preprocessed real-world real estate data
- Handled missing values, inconsistent entries, and outliers
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify pricing trends
- Applied feature engineering to improve model performance
- Built and evaluated a Linear Regression model for house price prediction
- Visualized insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn

---

## Key Insights
- Location has the highest impact on property pricing
- Price per square foot varies significantly across neighborhoods
- Property size influences price but not always linearly

---

## Model Performance
- Evaluated using R² score
- Achieved reliable predictive accuracy
- Validated using train-test split and cross-validation

---

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required Python libraries
3. Open `bhp.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
4. Run all cells sequentially

---

## Resume-Ready Project Highlights
